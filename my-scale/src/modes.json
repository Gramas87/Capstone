It's often used in metal and hip-hop",

It's very versatile because every chord brings you a new layer of emotional intensity. It's great for story telling. The VI, V, IV, V it's sad but uplifting. It makes you feel like you are in a journey because it never resolve to the tonic. The I,IV,VI,V progression starts with 2 major and uplifting chords that create a sense of lost when it reach the VI and finally resolve to the V giving a sense of closure ",

            "usage": "When soloing over a Major chord progression you want to sounds optimistic and bright and you can archive this especially by playing the 3th note of the chord that is playing underneath in that moment. Doing this you are going to enhance the quality of the chord. You can also play in a more scalar way and resolve on the root note this will also prevent you to sound dissonant by not staying on the 2th or the 4th of the chord too much",
